            Did you ever hear the tragedy of Darth Plageuis the Wise?<br>
            I thought not.<br>
            It is not a story the Jedi would tell you.
        </p>
        <p class="process-text">
            It's a Sith legend. Darth Plageuis was a Dark lord of the Sith,<br>
            so powerful and so wise he could use the Force<br>
            to influence the midichlorians to create life...
        </p>
        <p class="process-text">
            He had such a knowledge of the dark side that he could even<br>
            keep the ones he cared about from dying.<br>
            The dark side of the Force is a pathway to many abilities some<br>
            consider to be... unnatural.
        </p>
        <p class="process-text">
            He became so powerful...<br>
            the only thing he was afraid of was losing his power,<br>
            which eventually, of course, he did.
        </p>
        <p class="process-text">
            Unfortunately, he taught his apprentice everything he knew,<br>
            then his apprentice killed him in his sleep.<br>
            Ironic.<br>
            He could save others from death, but not himself.
